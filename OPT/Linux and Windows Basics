    Linux treats everything as a file
    use file <dir/file name> to understand the usage of specific file
    use man <command> to get manual pages of command meaning and its usage, also use help tags (-h)
    Also understand the importance of permissions

    id - displays users and group names
    uname - prints details about operating system's kernal
            use -a to get detailed information

    sudo -l - commands that can be run as a root user
    In "id" root users are represented by 0 and regular users are represented by 1000
    strings - shows printable characters in a binary
    head/tail - used to print only the first or last lines of a file
    Permissions:
        groups = owner, group, users
        types = r - read, w - write, x - executable, d - is a dir
    ps aux - prints all running processes

-> WHEN
    Need a cron utility which is useful for privilege escalation, and execute certain commands at certain times, reverse shelling

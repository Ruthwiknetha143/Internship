-> Important protocols
    ICMP - for pinging
    TCP - Three-way handshake and reliable connections
    UDP - Faster handshakes and unreliable connections
    GOAL - find weaknesses in the softwares that use these protocols
    Ports - doorways for interaction of network services

-> Tools for network enumeration
    nmap, netcat, masscann

-> nmap commands

    nmap <ip-address> - scan a single ip address with top 1000 ports
    nmap <192.0.1.1/24>--  Both of them used to scan multiple ip addresses at once
         <192.0.1.1-100>
    -iL <file_name> - Scan targets from the file
    -p - single or a range of ports
    -p- - for scanning all 65535 ports

    -sU - UDP scanning
    -Pn - No ping scan
    output to a file
        -oN = Normal
        -oX = XML file
        -oG = grepable
        -oA = all formats
    -T<0-5> - timed scans

    -sC - used to scan with default scripts
    -sV - used to get the service version
    --script-vuln - used NSE (Nmap scripting engine)
    -A - aggresive scan
    -n - No DNS resolution
    --randomized-hosts - scans completely randomized
    --send-eth - sends using way libpcap

-> masscan commands

    Need separate open ports to dump information regarding scanned ports
    P.S - Need to learn a bit about "iptables" firewalling
    Has a bit of a learning curve, need to use it regularly

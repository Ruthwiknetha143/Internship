- Always have a mindset to exploit server-side attacks for maximum potential in bug bounty

- When using nmap to enumerate the web server, check for the version of Apache/Nginx/IIS, for server-side vulnerabilites

- Also try to brute-force the web server directories to find admin dir/ some juicy information dirs required for further enumeration

- Tools used for web-server enumeration

    - Nikto is a good web server enumeration tool, but is prone to a lot of noise
    - dirb is another brute-forcing tool for web server enumeration which is considerably fast (prefer to run this first before other tools), contains a default wordlist called
        dirbuster
    - gobuster is also another brute-forcing tool for web server enumeration
    - Wappalyzer can help enumerate the website technology

- Extra options:
    - Look at robot.txt
    - View source of the page and check for cookies
    - Use cURL to view the page for extra information

- Tools for intercepting proxy
    - Portswigger's BurpSuite - Ensure to install Burp's CA certificate for all HTTPS sites to mitigate any error pop ups (optional)
    - OWASP's ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) - Uses automated scanning and spidering

- Payload types
    Sniper

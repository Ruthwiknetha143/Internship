-> Linux filesystem - case-sensitive
    /root - root users home dir
    /home or ~ - user's dir
    /etc - system config files and shadows files
    /bin and /sbin - System binaries, contains info about commands you can run
    /usr - user's binaries and libraries can be found here
    /var - contains logs and apaches, web files can also be found
    /dev - device drivers
    /lib - contains shared libraries
    /boot - files for booting system
    /mnt - mount point for media such as CD/DVD/USB
    /proc - contains processes marked as files
    /tmp - holds temporary files (important)

-> # - root
    $ - non-root
    Linux treats everything as a file
    use file <dir/file name> to understand the usage of specific file
    use man <command> to get manual pages of command meaning and its usage, also use help tags (-h)
    Also understand the importance of permissions
    history - to look at used commands

-> WHO
    whoami - to display the current user
    id - displays users and group names
    uname - prints details about operating system's kernal
            use -a to get detailed information

-> WHAT
    sudo -l - commands that can be run as a root user
    In "id" root users are represented by 0 and regular users are represented by 1000
    strings - shows printable characters in a binary
    head/tail - used to print only the first or last lines of a file
    Permissions:
        groups = owner, group, users
        types = r - read, w - write, x - executable, d - is a dir
    ps aux - prints all running processes

-> WHEN
    Need a cron utility which is useful for privilege escalation, and execute certain commands at certain times, reverse shelling

-> WHERE

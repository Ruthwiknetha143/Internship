---> A4 -- Insecure design - It refers to the lack of security controls and considerations in the architecture and design of a system, leading to vulnerabilities that can be 
  exploited by attackers

-types of vulnerabilities
  1. Insecure OS/Firmware - Usage of default of OS builds/firmware or insecure practices done on an OS can lead to many vulnerabilities which can lead to BAC, Injection attacks,
      data breaches, etc

      Some of the most common vulnerabilities caused/leveraged by this issue are CWE-259, 798: Hardcoded credentials, CWE-732: Over permissioned credentials, Local administrator
      on default environment, unvalidated firmware updates (maybe unencrypted as well), CWE-922, 255, 1273: shared credentials on the storage

  2. CWE-922: Insecure data storage - self-explanatory, but some of the key points which are used to categorize into this vulnerability are

      CWE-200: Sensitive data stored in unencrypted from on external storage, CWE-312: Server-side storage of sensitive data in plain-text, CWE-524, 525: caching of sensitive 
      information

  3. Insecure data transport - Transmission of data through an application in an insecure format some of the key points are

      CWE-353, 494: No secure integrity check for an executable download, CWE-319: Cleartext transmission of sensitive information

  All of this vulnerabilities are due to the ignorance of the entire development front-end, back-end and database. And all of these vulnerabilities can be exploited by the usage 
  of before mentioned techniques i.e, injection techniques, packet-sniffing, man-in-the-middle attack, etc

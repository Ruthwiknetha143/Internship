--> Command prompt - It is CLI interface used to work with the resources or folders or files of the windows OS(only)
  .bat files can be created which are batch scripts used to execute a set of cmd commands in one go (basically automation)

-Basic cmd commands:
  1. Navigation

             to go to specific directory path - cd <directory_path>
             to move back from the current working directory - cd .. 
             as well to go back certain number of directories - cd../../..
             to go the starting of the disc you are in - cd \
             displays the current working directory - cd

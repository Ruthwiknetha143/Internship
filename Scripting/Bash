---> Bash (Bourne Again SHell) - It is a developed version of Bourne shell which is mainly used in UNIX based/LINUX based kernals to interact with the hardware of the
  Operating system

- Always start the script with a shebang --> #!/bin/bash
- shebang allows for the usage of bash language in the the file being created
- Be sure to understand that the syntax of all the command and statements are case-sensitive and space-sensitive

- Basic commands:
  + echo "some message" - basically print command
  + $<variable_name> - for calling variables in the echo command (can be reassigned within the same script)
  + read <variable_name> - used to take input of the user (follow up with a variable name to store the input)
  + exit <error_code> - <error_code> needs to be apt for basic usage

Note: There are several in-build variables such as $SHELL, $RANDOM, $PWD, which can be used as well for the scripting. Also you can add your own variables and make it 
  available across the system by adding it in the .bashrc file, which can be found in the /root directory

- Arithmetic operations:
  + $(()) - Always be sure to cover your arithmetic operations in this parenthesis for the shell to interpret that there is arithmetic operation going on

  + if [[ <variable> == <some_variable/input> ]]; then
          //statement
    else
          //statement
    fi

  + && - AND
    || - OR

  + >,<,>=,<=,==(str),-eq(int) - comparision operators
